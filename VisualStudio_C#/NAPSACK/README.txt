I know I mentioned I could add an installer that could create 
a shortcut to the executable project, but Gmail recognized it as 
a virus since it is an installer.exe so I can't send it to you. 
Either way you can access the executable from the files I sent, 
you just have to extract the folder:
TSO_1889295_FinalProject -> Folder
and you should still be able to run the program 
by:
1) Opening the whole project from visual studio and executing.
or
2) Findin the executable in this location from the 
TSO_1889295_FinalProject -> folder:
TSO_1889295_FinalProject\NapsackTSO_02\bin\Debug\NapsackTSO_02.exe

Thank you!
